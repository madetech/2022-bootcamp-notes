# Command line tips

## Changing directory
Use the command `cd <DIR>` to change to the directory specified in `<DIR>`.

eg. The command `cd scripts` would change into the directory scripts.

### NB
Using the command `cd ..` will change the directory up one level.

eg. If you are in the directory `C:\Program Files\Git\tmp` executing `cd ..` will leave you in the directory `C:\Program Files\Git`.

## Running javascript scripts
The command `node <FILE>` will run the file that is specified in `<FILE>`.

eg. The command `node index.js` would run the script `index.js`
